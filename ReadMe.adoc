= Project: Arduino IoT Water Pump Controller

This project is an **automated water pump system** that connects to the **Arduino IoT Cloud**, allowing users to monitor and control a water pump remotely.  
It includes a **schedule system** to turn the pump on/off at specific times and an **LED status indicator** showing connection and pump activity.

The project can be used for home garden irrigation, aquarium management, or any automated liquid control system that requires time-based activation.

== Step 1: Installation
1. Open the sketch folder in the Arduino IDE.  
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed:
   - ArduinoIoTCloud
   - WiFiConnectionManager
   - Ticker  
3. Replace your Wi-Fi credentials and IoT credentials in `arduino_secrets.h`.
4. Compile and upload the code to your Arduino-compatible board (ESP8266/ESP32 recommended).
5. Open the Serial Monitor at 9600 baud to check connection status.

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit
Follow the circuit diagram shown in `layout.png`.

Basic connections:
- **Pin D5 (Output)** → Relay module (controls water pump)  
- **Pin D2 (LED)** → On-board LED or external indicator  
- **VCC / GND** → Power and ground connections  
- **Relay COM/NO** → Connected in series with the pump and power supply  

When the system is active, the LED stays **ON**. When idle or disconnected, it **blinks** every 1 second.

== Step 3: Load the code
Upload the sketch to your board using Arduino IDE.

The program will:
- Connect to Arduino IoT Cloud  
- Sync time automatically  
- Control the pump based on schedule or manual switch from Dashboard  
- Count the number of activations (`counter`)  
- Display debug information on Serial Monitor
