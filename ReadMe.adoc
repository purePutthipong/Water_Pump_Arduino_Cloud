== Overview
This project implements an *automatic water pump system* connected to the *Arduino IoT Cloud*.  
It allows remote control and scheduling of the pump, while displaying system status via an LED indicator.

Use cases include:
* Smart garden irrigation  
* Aquarium management  
* Home automation liquid systems  

== Step 1: Installation
Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. Open this folder in the Arduino IDE.  
2. Install the required libraries:
   * ArduinoIoTCloud
   * WiFiConnectionManager
   * Ticker  
3. Edit `arduino_secrets.h` and insert your Wi-Fi and IoT credentials.  
4. Connect your ESP8266 or ESP32 board.  
5. Upload the code to the board.  
6. Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud to confirm the connection.

== Step 2: Circuit Assembly
Assemble the circuit following `layout.png`.

|===
| Pin | Connection | Description
| D5 | Relay Input | Controls the pump on/off
| D2 | LED Output | Status indicator
| VCC/GND | Power | Board and relay power
| Relay COM/NO | Pump circuit | Connects to pump power line
|===

LED indicator:
* Blinking → waiting or connecting  
* Solid ON → pump running  

== Step 3: Load the Code
Upload the `.ino` sketch to your board.

The code will:
* Connect to Arduino IoT Cloud  
* Retrieve local time automatically  
* Operate based on schedule or manual control  
* Update a counter for pump activations  
* Show debug info in Serial Monitor
