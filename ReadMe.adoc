= Project: Arduino IoT Water Pump Controller

This project implements an **automatic water pump system** that connects to the **Arduino IoT Cloud**.  
It allows you to remotely control and monitor the pump, schedule operation times, and display status using an onboard LED indicator.

Use cases include:
* Smart garden irrigation  
* Aquarium water management  
* Home automation systems requiring timed liquid flow control  

== Step 1: Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. Open this project folder in the Arduino IDE.  
2. Install the required libraries:
   * ArduinoIoTCloud  
   * WiFiConnectionManager  
   * Ticker  
3. Edit `arduino_secrets.h` and insert your Wi-Fi credentials and Arduino IoT Cloud credentials.  
4. Connect your ESP8266 or ESP32 board.  
5. Upload the code to the board.  
6. Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to confirm the connection.

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Wire the components according to the `layout.png` file included in this sketch.

Connection summary:
* D5 → Relay module input (controls pump)
* D2 → LED indicator output
* VCC/GND → Power for relay and board
* Relay COM/NO → Connected to pump and power line

LED indicator behavior:
* **Blinking:** waiting/idle or connecting  
* **Solid ON:** pump is running  

== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the provided `.ino` sketch to your board.  
The program will:
* Connect automatically to Arduino IoT Cloud  
* Retrieve local time from the cloud  
* Operate the pump according to the defined schedule  
* Allow manual control from the IoT Dashboard  
* Count pump activations with the `counter` variable  
* Display system status in Serial Monitor
